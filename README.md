# odin-recipes
Project to build a basic recipe webiste. Starting with HTML as the building blocks, moving to CSS later.

## Before I Begin, Reflection
I have no real idea what the exact end results are supposed to be. I hope to be able to understand the relationship between the IDE I'm working in, my repo for this project, the basics of working on code while tracking the work in Gitub, and basics of HTML. A lot of stuff now that I'm looking at it.

## End of the Project, Reflection
