        <li>Bay leaf</li>
        <li>1/2 teaspoon cumin seeds</li>
        <li>Salt</li>
    </ul>
    <p>To make the burritos</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Vegetable or canola oil</li>
        <li>1/2 pound of chorizo</li>
        <li>1/2 cup finely chopped yellow onion</li>
        <li>1/2 cup finely copped green bell pepper</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper</li>
        <li>2 garlic cloves, minced</li>
        <li>1/2 store-bought pico de gallo or salsa</li>
        <li>1/4 teaspoon smoked paprika</li>
        <li>6 (9-to 10-inch) flour tortillas</li>
        <li>1.5 to 2 cups shredded sharp Cheddar</li>
        <li>Sour cream, hot sauce and avocado for serving</li>
    </ul>
    
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Add the dried beans to the instant pot, cover with 2 inches of water. 
            Add the garlic, bay leaf, cumin seeds, and 1/2 teaspoon of salt.
            Give it all a stir for luck. Put the lid on and set it to 24 minuets. 
            When the time is up, manually release and taste a few beans to ensure
            they are cooked through. Reserve a 1/2 cup of the bean water and drain
            the rest off.
        </li><br>
        <li>While the beans are cooking, remove the casing from the chorizo and add 
            to a cold, 10-inch skillet. Over medium-high heat, break the chorizo up
            into very small pieces and saute until cooked through. Place the cooked
            chorizo to the side for use later, wipe the skillet out.
        </li><br>
        <li>To a skillet, add a tablespoon of oil over medium heat. Add onion and bell
            pepper, season with some salt and pepper, stilling occasionally, until
            tender. Stir in garlic, until it comes alive. Add your beans, salsa, smoked
            paprika, and the reserved bean liquid. As the beans cook, give them an occasional
            stir and use the back of a spoon or potato masher to a consistency of your
            choosing. When all the liquid is absorbed and the mixture is thick, season
            to taste with more salt and pepper. Transfer the beans to a bowl, and wipe
            the skillet out once again.
        </li><br>
        <li>In each tortilla, spread out around 1/2 cup of refried beans and 1/3
            cup of the cheese, top with chorizo. Fold the tortilla up into a tight roll.
        </li><br>
        <li>Back in the skillet, heat about 1 tablespoon of oil over medium. Once the 
            pan is hot, add as many burritos as will fit, seam side down. Turn them
            occasionally until golden on all sides. Continue with the next batch of 
            burritos, adding more oil if the pan dries out. Serve with whatever fixing
            you prefer.
        </li>
    </ol>
